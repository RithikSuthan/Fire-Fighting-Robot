# Firefighting Robot Project

## Overview
Fire disasters pose significant risks, potentially resulting in heavy financial losses and loss of lives. To mitigate these risks, we are developing an autonomous firefighting robot equipped with IoT technology. The robot aims to detect and extinguish small flames in hazardous environments, reducing reliance on human intervention and minimizing the risk to firefighters' lives.

## Objective
The objective of our firefighting robot project is to enhance firefighting capabilities by deploying an autonomous robot equipped with IoT technology. The robot aims to detect and extinguish small flames in hazardous environments swiftly and efficiently, thereby mitigating financial losses and preventing the loss of lives associated with fire disasters.

## Scope
The scope of the project involves designing and implementing an autonomous firefighting robot equipped with IoT technology. The robot will operate within a predefined boundary range, detecting and extinguishing small flames within its vicinity. Stakeholders can receive real-time notifications once the flame is detected or extinguished, allowing for prompt monitoring and response.

### Features
- **Flame Detection System:** Integrating flame detection sensors to identify and locate fire incidents within the robot's operational range.
- **Fire Extinguishing Procedure:** Implementing a submersible water pump for extinguishing fires, which sprays water for a certain amount of time when a flame is detected within the given range.
- **Navigation Towards the Fire:** Developing the robot to navigate autonomously within its range, ensuring proper directions in response to fire location.
- **Actuation Mechanism Design:** Incorporating relays for controlled deployment of water to extinguish flames.
- **Mobile Application and Notification Management:** Creation of a simple interface using BLYNK IoT for viewing the intensity of the fire in the app interface and enabling notifications about fire detection in the range.
